## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology".

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS Framework

### What I learned

This project really pushed me, but I really had a lot of fun with it.

The hardest part was getting the different components and views to comminucate and pass information between each other. Once I got the hang of that, the rest of the project went fairly quickly.

All data is being pulled from a JSON file, so the code is very modular.

### Continued development

I'm getting more comfortable with Vue. There's still so much to learn and do though.
